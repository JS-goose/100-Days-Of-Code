# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 38: May 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today was a much slower day after turning in my project yesterday I worked on the GitHub lessons I skipped to get to the memory game.  I learned and practiced:
* `git commit --amend`
* `git revert`
* `git fetch`

Also finished lesson 15/16 and started lesson 17.

**Thoughts:** Today was a nice chill day especially after moving at break-neck speed trying to finish up my project.  I write physical notes and it felt good to put pen to paper but also learn new techniques using Git/GitHub.
