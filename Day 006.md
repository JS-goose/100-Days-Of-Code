# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of the Udacity Nanodegree and I started responsive web design section.  Learning about DIP's and remote debugging have fried my brain.

**Thoughts:** It took me a long time to set up my phone for remote debugging because I'm using a Samsung S8, so here are the links I used to help me get this set up:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/" target="_blank">Tools for Web Developers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21925992/chrome-devtools-devices-does-not-detect-device-when-plugged-in" target="_blank">Chrome DevTools Device Set Up For Samsung Phones</a></li>
</ul>
