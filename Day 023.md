# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 23: May 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I resubmitted my Pixel Art Maker (after making some changes to the code) and finished lesson 12 (adding commits to a repo) in the nanodegree.

**Thoughts:** I'm stoked that my code passed for the Pixel Art Maker.  I'm also going to rewrite the project in JavaScript as I used jQuery for this submission.  Also, learning version control/Git has not been nearly as daunting as I once thought it would be.
