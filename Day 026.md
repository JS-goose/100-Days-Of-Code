# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the merge conflict section and practiced the commands `git merge, git commit --amend, git log --oneline`, finished lesson 19 Introduction to the DOM and started lesson 20 - DOM selectors.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to skip around in the curriculum so that I can get closer to Project 2 and start working on it.  I want to have ample time to complete it and get my review back before May 28th.  Then I will go back to finish the lessons I skipped.
