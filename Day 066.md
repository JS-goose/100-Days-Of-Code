# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 66: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* learned about `Sets` and `Maps`
* practiced creating/modifying/deleting `Sets` and `Maps`
* Finished a few fCC modules on Applied Visual Design


**Thoughts:** These past few lessons in the nanodegree have been crazy complex for me.  I've been taking extra time to learn and practice what I've been learning.  I feel like practicing it as I learn it as well as going over my notes the next day have helped solidify my knowledge.  I also feel like this is actually sticking in my brain -- who would have though!
