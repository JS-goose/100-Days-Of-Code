# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 24: May 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished lesson 13 (adding commits), practiced new Git commands on the terminal (`git show, git log, git diff`) and learned about some the flags associated with these commands.  Also started lesson 14 (tagging, branching, merging).

**Thoughts:** Today was a super chill day, didn't get much coding done as I got out of my usual routine of getting up early and coding in the morning.  I guess they can't all be winners.  Tomorrow will be better!
