# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 83: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started and finished sections 3.22.10-3.22.14
* Learned about testing synchronous code with Jasmine
* Started section on testing asynchronous code
* Edited footer on LSB site

**Thoughts:** 
Jasmine seems fairly straight forward and I enjoy writing the code.  It's extremely easy to read and write so either I'm doing something wrong or it's just a very well written testing suite.  I think a little of both :D
