# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the first project of the #JavaScript30 by Wes Bos.  It's a drumkit soundboard that I'm looking forward to working on.  I set up my file structure and almost finished the HTML portion.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to be building projects with JS again but not sure how far I will get as my Udacity course starts soon.  I also worked on 2 blog posts, one dealing with the correct element selector to use in JavaScript.
