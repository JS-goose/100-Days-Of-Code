# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 61: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.9.6 (`Object.create()`)
* Learned that all objects share a link through `__proto__` property
* Started section 3.10 (ES6 Function Changes)

**Thoughts:** I've learned a lot about object oriented programming in the last few days.  This is a portion of JavaScript (and there's many more) that I was very unclear on.  I'm happy with my progress and I'm having so much fun learning all of this!
