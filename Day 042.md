# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 42: June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 3 
* Learned how to write semantically correct HTML in terms of ARIA
* Learned and practiced making text fields accessible to screen readers by wrapping the `input` in a `label`
* Started lesson 4


**Thoughts:** This section has been very frustrating not because of the content but how it's presented...hoping the following sections are not like this.  I am enjoying the content and learning more advanced techniques for accessibility.
