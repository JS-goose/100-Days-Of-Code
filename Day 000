# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the logic on the RGB Guessing Game modes, the "New Colors" button, added the trademark and social links

**Thoughts:** I managed to get the logic working after an hour or so of struggling with the functionality.  I have noticed myself working through issues logically and from a top down perspective...I'm very happy with how my brain is essentially "rewiring" itself to "think like a programmer".
