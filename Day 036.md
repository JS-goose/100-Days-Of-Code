# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 36: May 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I built the congratulations modal, added `winGame()` logic, and added in the winning game stats. `forEach()` oh how I love thee!  Finally submitted my project!

**Thoughts:** This was an interesting day of coding and this project has been nothing if not fun!  I struggled with some of the functions (displaying shuffled cards) and got stressed especially with the deadline looming.  I managed to get it submitted on time, now to wait for the review!
