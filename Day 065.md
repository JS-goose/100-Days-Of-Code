# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 65: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished sections 3.10.18 - 3.10.21
* Started section 3.11 (Built Ins)
* Scratched the surface with using `Symbol()` to uniquely identify properties of objects
* Started learning about the `iterable / iterator` protocols in ES6
* Completed a few hours of FCC challenges with Applied Visual Design


**Thoughts:** I'm slowly getting my motivation back and it feels amazing.  I had plenty of time to code today but only ended up putting in about 4 hours (I had all day).  I'm trying not to get burnt out as I think I was going after it a little too much.  I need to learn it's ok to take breaks and that I cannot learn everything in one day.
