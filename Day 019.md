# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Started by learning about destructuring arrays and objects (the syntax is so intuitive and easy to read), moved on to object literal shorthand, and then worked through to the `for...of loop` section in the Udacity nanodegree.

**Thoughts:** These new ES6 changes (new to me) are awesome and have me stoked to keep learning JavaScript.  I've found that I'm constantly thinking about ways to use what I'm learning.
