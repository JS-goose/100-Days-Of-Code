# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 80: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.22.1 - Testing with Jasmine
* Set up file structure for the LSB site
* Did some research for design ideas on this new freelance project

**Thoughts:** 
I believe this will be my last freelance gig until I finish the nanodegree at the end of October.  I enjoy the work but it does complicate my schedule and stress me out sometimes.
