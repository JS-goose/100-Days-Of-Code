# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I refactored my code to keep it DRY as there were many parts where I repeated the exact same code.  The game is officially finished and I'll be moving onto another project soon.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't aware of exactly how .querySeclectorAll() worked so when I used it to select multiple HTML elements and then style them through JS it wasn't producing the expected result.  I used the .forEach() method to produce the desired result.  I will do more research into selectors and possibly a blog post
