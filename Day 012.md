# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 12: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Learned about the 4 most common responsive design patterns, edited some local sites to add break points and change the layout depending on which style I wanted to use.  Did a few projects in Grid Garden and Flexbox Froggy

**Thoughts:** These design patterns are something I've searched for in previous website designs, I just didn't know what I was looking for.  I also found out that I've used several of these patterns in previous projects without knowing it.
