# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 41: June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 3.3.1 
* Learned how to find focus that's seemingly lost with `document.activeElement`
* learned and practiced keeping focus from going to off screen elements
* worked on lessons 3.3.3 - 3.3.10
* Was introduced to the `accessibility tree` and how elements need to have `name, role, state, and value` for use with screen readers

**Thoughts:** Using JS to access/modify radio buttons proved tricky and I don't think I still quite understand it but I plan to go back and practice some more.  I have learned much more than I knew even existed in the realm of accessibility and I'm grateful for that.
