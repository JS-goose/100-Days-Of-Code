# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 46: June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.7 - Objects in Depth
* learned how the basics of object structures
* Practiced using `new Object()` constructor


**Thoughts:** Objects have always intrigued me and I'm looking forward to working more with them.  I haven't yet had a need for them in my projects but I know that will change soon!
