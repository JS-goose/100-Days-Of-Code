# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 72: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Work on the Arcade Game continues
* Character movement has been smoothed out
* Boundaries set for player movement
* Got the enemies to render by populating an array `allEnemies` and then looping over the array and calling the `.render()` function


**Thoughts:** Switching between the multiple JavaScript source files has been confusing and thrown me for a loop more than once.  I've spent more time than I care to admit wondering why my function wasn't working only to realize that I had commented it out in another file.
