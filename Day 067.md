# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 67: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished a quiz using destructuring on a map and looping over it with a `for...of` loop
* Finished the `Looping over a map` section
* Started and finished section on WeakMaps
* Started and finished section 3.11.18 (Promises)
* Started section 3.11.21 (Proxies)


**Thoughts:** The code for promises and proxies has really thrown me for a loop (pun intended).  I'll definitely have to review these sections as I feel like I have plenty of "what is this code" but not "when/why to use this code" floating around in my brain.
