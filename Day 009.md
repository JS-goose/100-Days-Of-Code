# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9: April 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Udacityh orientation video just to orientate myself with the nanodegree classroom.  More work with identifying and adding break points.  Implemented more media queries and worked on complex media queries (multiple stylesheets)

**Thoughts:** Woriking with min-width and max-width in terms of media queries has been baffling.  I believe max-width is used iff the viewport is below a certain width the rules are applied and if the viewport is above a certain width min-width rules are applied.
