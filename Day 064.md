# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 64: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* More work with classes and subclasses 
* Learned about `static` methods and how they are accessible by the prototype
* Finished lesson 3.10.16
* Started section 3.10.17 and 3.10.18 (`extends` and `super`)
* Added new banner to the freelance project I'm working on and sent a preview to my contact

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying object oriented programming theory but I know I'll need to use some external assets to fully understand it.  I feel like it's making sense (for the most part) but I'm anxious to use it...just need to find time for a project to test my new knowledge.
