# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 60: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* More work on section 3.9.5 (Prototypal Inheritance)
* Practiced using the `constructor` property of objects
* Started section 3.9.6 (Subclasses)

**Thoughts:** Today my mental motivation was minimal.  I did an hour of coding and then couldn't find enough in the tank to do anything else.  Work and side gigs are taking their toll but I refuse to give up.
