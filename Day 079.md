# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 78: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.19 on Optimization with CSS/JS file concatenation
* Worked through some examples of image compression
* Learned about source maps and how to use them after my files have been concatenated

**Thoughts:** 
More energy today than previous days.  I got some time to chill and relax last night so I think that helped me push through these sections in my nanodegree.
