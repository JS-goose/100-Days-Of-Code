# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 52: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.8.2 (Callbacks)
* practiced more callback function writing
* learned that some array methods (`.filter(), .map(), .forEach()`) are callback functions


**Thoughts:** Callbacks haven't proven to be the very scary aspects of JavaScript I thought they were.  I can see how they are useful especially having another function delegate function invoking.  Now to find out when to use them!
