# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 59: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.9.5 (Prototypal Inheritance)
* Practiced using `.hasOwnProperty()`, `isPrototypeOf`, and `Object.getPrototypeOf()`
* Added some header styling / card info on the freelance project I'm working on

**Thoughts:** Prototypal inheritance is hugely intriguing for me.  I want to learn so much more about it but I feel like if I spend anymore time on it my projects will suffer.  I will defintely be coming back to it.  Also, I'm happy to be working on this freelance project but I chose a terrible time (during this Nanodegree) to do so as I'm having to split time between too many things.
