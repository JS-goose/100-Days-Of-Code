# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the flexbox section in the nanodegree, started working on a dedicated flexbox course from Scrimba, and learned about the flex-direction as well as flex-grow.  I decided to take a charity gig for a local memorial scholarship fund also.

**Thoughts:** I felt like there was so much more to flexbox and expected to be working on this for a while.  I feel like this will be one of those skills that is easy to pickup but difficult to master.  I embrace the challenge!
