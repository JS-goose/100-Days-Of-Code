# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 56: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started working on section 3.9 (object oriented programming)
* Learned about constructor functions
* Practiced writing constructor functions

**Thoughts:** Constructor functions seem immensely powerful and useful.  I can create an unlimited number of objects with one function!  On a side note, FCC has decided to publish one of my articles on JavaScript!
