# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I thought I had a decent grasp on media queries and break points until I went to implement them on a few different pieces I wanted to be responsive at different viewport widths.  Spent the better part of two hours fiddling around with them in dev tools but I finally got what I wanted.  I also learned about the <code>stopPropogation()</code> method, and used it in my hamburger functionality!  

**Thoughts:** I feel like editing an established site to implement Flexbox is far more difficult than just rebuilding the site from the ground up with Flexbox.  I gave it serious thought today but did't get frustrated to the point of mental exhaustion like I normall would so I'm proud of myself!
