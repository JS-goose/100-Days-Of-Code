# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on responsive images in the nanodegree.  I learned and practice how to make tables and fonts responsive.  Learned about the `srcset` attribute as well.

**Thoughts:** Making websites responsive with media queries and breakpoints is something that I've easily picked up but I can tell it will be difficutl to master.  I keep hearing the phrase, "it's an art, not a science" which I have found is true.
