# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on responsive web design and started editing local sites to add breakpoints.  Began the media queries section in my nanodegree.

**Thoughts:** Still working on wrapping my brain around breakpoints and setting media queries using embed or linked stylesheets.
