# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 73: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* enemies function has been set
* Used another loop and  a function with 3 parameters `x-axis`, `y-axis`, and `speed`
* Collision detection set but I'm not sure it's bullet proof...doesn't register on some of the faster moving enemies

**Thoughts:** 
I believe some of the enemies are on a different `y-axis` position than the player.  Visually they appear to be on the same axis but I think they are off just a few pixels and that's causing them to not register a collision.  I will fix that tomorrow!
