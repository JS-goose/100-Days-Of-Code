# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 89: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started writing tests for Udacity Feed Reader Project
* Updated the name and URL tests to get them to pass
* Debugged code to access nested objects within an array 

**Thoughts:** 
LSB site went live on time, it's not finished but presentable at least.  Project 4 is moving along smoothly.
