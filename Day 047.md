# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 47: June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started lesson 3.7.2 - Creating and Modifying Object Properties


**Thoughts:** I've enjoyed this section so far but it's proving difficult to focus on coding, writing articles, working on side projects, getting ready for the wedding, and all the other things that come with being an adult.  I've decided to take a small break until after we get back from the honeymoon.  I'm not giving up though!
