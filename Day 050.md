# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 50: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.7 (and thus all of the objects unit)
* learned how `this` applies to objects and methods
* Practiced using `this` on objects and learned about the `window` object


**Thoughts:** This section was very useful and I enjoyed learning about objects and the window object.  I also learned how the `window object` can track mouse position, page URL, and opening a new page

* [The Window Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)
