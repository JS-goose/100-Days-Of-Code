# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 92: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Refactored async code for Feed Reader Testing to meet review standards
* Debugged an issue where local variables were not being captured
* Edited `README.md` on Feed Reader Project with instructions to run application
* Initialized repo and directory for `cat clicker app`

**Thoughts:** 
Fingeres crossed Project 4 passes this time, I had fun but I'm looking forward to moving on to the `cat clicker app` project :D
