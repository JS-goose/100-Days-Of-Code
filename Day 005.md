# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the Grow With Google & Udacity 6 month Nanodegree for Front End Web Development today!  I went through some of the HTML/CSS lessons to get the basics out of the way.  Finished up my 2nd animal trading card and submitted the lab for it. 

**Thoughts:** I need to focus on the instructions for labs.  I spent more than 30 mins trying to figure out why my lab wasn't passing and it was a simple mistake that could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the instructions.
