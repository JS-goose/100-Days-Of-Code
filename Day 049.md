# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 49: June 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.3
* Practiced building objects and invoking methods within them


**Thoughts:** Objects seem very useful and I can see how they integrate into the larger picture of JavaScript programming.  I'm excited to use them in my side projects in the future.
