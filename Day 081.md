# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 81: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Built the skeleton wirefram of the LSB site
* Added basic styling 
* Built the video section and CTA section as well

**Thoughts:** 
I believe this will be my last freelance gig until I finish the nanodegree at the end of October.  I enjoy the work but it does complicate my schedule and stress me out sometimes.
