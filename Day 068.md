# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 68: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.11.21 on ES6 proxies
* Started section 3.11.22 on the difference between `getter/setter` and ES6 proxies


**Thoughts:** Haven't had much motivation for coding today and only finished one section in the nanodegree.
