# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 68: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.11.21 on ES6 proxies
* Started section 3.11.22 on the difference between `getter/setter` and ES6 proxies


**Thoughts:** The code for promises and proxies has really thrown me for a loop (pun intended).  I'll definitely have to review these sections as I feel like I have plenty of "what is this code" but not "when/why to use this code" floating around in my brain.
