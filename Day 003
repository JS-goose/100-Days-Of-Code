# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More work on the drumkit project with setting up my selectors and some styling.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have much time to code today and I barely squeeked in an hour.  I did some reading in Eloquent JS and would like to continue more in that book but finding time is very difficult!
