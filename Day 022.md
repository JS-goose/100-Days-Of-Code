# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 22: May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Started the HTML/CSS wireframing for the site for a local charity and finished lessons 10 and 11 in the Udacity Nanodegree (learning version control/Git) then started lesson 12.

**Thoughts:** Maybe taking on a freelance gig while I'm under pressure to meet deadlines at work and in my Nanodegree, but I couldn't say not to this one.  It's for a local charity/scholarship fund for a local teenager killed by a drunk driver, hard to say no to that.
