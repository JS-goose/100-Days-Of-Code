# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 37: May 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I got my review back and everything except for 1 aspect passed!  I added in a media query for screens below `580px` and had to adjust the height and width of my game board for smaller screens.  I accomplished this by setting the display to `flex` and using `min` and `max-height` as well as `min` and `max-width`.

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy that I got a great review!  I was worried that my code looked like spaghetti (still am) and that it would be difficult to follow my thought process.  I'm thankful that all I had to do was add in some responsiveness.  On to the next project!
