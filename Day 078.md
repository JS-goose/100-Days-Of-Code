# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 79: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.18
* Started and finished sections 3.19.1 - 3.19.12
* Completed some fCC exercises on CSS selectors as a refresher

**Thoughts:** 
It's good to go back through some content on CSS as I want to be very knowledgeable with it.  I have some intermediate knowledge but there's always room for improvement.
