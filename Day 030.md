# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 30: May 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Set up the repo for project 2, set the boilerplate code (HTML) and header for the project as well.  Established the file structure for the project and pushed initial commits from remote.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited but nervous about this project.  There are some aspects I'm not completely sure about but the first one on my mind is how to display a timer in JavaScript.  Is that a plugin or is there a loop I can write to display a timer?  I'm not sure but I plan to find out :)
