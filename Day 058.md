# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 58: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.9.4 (Setting Our Own `this`)
* Learned how to set the value of this with `.apply()` and `.bind()`
* Started section 3.9.5 (Prototypal Inheritance)
* Read the Objects chapter in Eloquent JavaScript
* Finished the functions problem set in Eloquent JavaScript
* Updated my portfolio site to include my most recent projects
* Worked on the freelance project for a local charity - added content and box styling to the header

**Thoughts:** Another productive day on the books!  I feel like I'm back and this has been some of the best coding time I've had in the past few days.  Working on this freelance project has really opened my eyes and made me want to do more pro bono work.  It will literally knock the dirt off of your soul!
