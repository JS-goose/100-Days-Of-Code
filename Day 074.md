# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 73: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Built the win modal in `HTML` and `CSS`
* Working on adding logic
* Location based winning logic is proving difficult to write as my exact `x-asix` and `y-axis` are not lining up

**Thoughts:** 
The modal was simple and easy to build but the logic is a real head scratcher.  I have a feeling my math is off as I'm moving 101 x 83 pixels each key stroke in a given direction.
