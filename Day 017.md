# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Spent about 2 hours finishing up my project and turned it in for review.  Once I got the review back I started making the suggested changes.  Most of the things were very minor except for one `div` that I forgot to wrap in a container and column/row.  Project has been resubmitted. 

**Thoughts:** The review was very helpful and provided some insight into how I pass over small things when I feel rushed.  I should have taken another day to go over my project and ensure things were in order.  Overall I am satisified with my work though!
