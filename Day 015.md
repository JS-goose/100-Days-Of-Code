# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I started working on my portfolio site today for Project 1 that is due on May 10th for the nanodegree.  I want to hand code it all but for the sake of time I'll be using bootstrap.  I got the HTML skeleton coded up, will add more later.

**Thoughts:** I like frameworks like bootstrap but I feel like they bloat my code and I spend more time reading the docs than I do actually coding.  I want to sit down and learn it really well so I don't have to keep flipping through tabs every so often.
