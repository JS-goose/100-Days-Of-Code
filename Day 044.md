# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 44: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 5.12 
* Tinkered with a quiz on ARIA attributes
* learned and practiced new ARIA techniques


**Thoughts:** ARIA is still a massive beast to me and I know it's important but it feels like this giant mystery that requries years of practice and implementation to get even a basic understanding of.  I push forward nonetheless!
