# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 82: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished wireframing the LSB site
* Added some place holder videos/images
* Added basic styling
* Finished a quiz on the Jasmine testing suite in nanodegree

**Thoughts:** 
I'm having a lot of fun building this site and I've found myself looking at it from a different perspective than normal.  I ask myself "Would this be useful?" or "How would I make use of this feature as a site user?".  I hope that my care and research shine through for my customer as this has been fun and a great learning experience so far.
