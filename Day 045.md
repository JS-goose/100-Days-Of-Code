# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 45: June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lessons 5.13 - 6.6
* learned how to style elements based on ARIA attributes instead of classes
* learned and practiced new ARIA semantics like `aria-live` `aria-hidden`


**Thoughts:** The section on styling ARIA attributes seems more manageable.  I've been really tough on myself lately because I'm not picking up the ideals and techniques as quickly as I want to but this is my first time through.  I need to cut myself some slack and realize that I'm not perfect and big deal if it takes me going over the material twice to learn it.  The important part is that I learn it.
