# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 24: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the branching/merging section of lesson 14 in nanodegree.  Created, edited, and merged two branches to practice my new Git skills.  Also practiced more on the terminal with new Git commands (`checkout, merge, tag`).

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to be learning Git finally.  The power and responsiveness it brings to my projects with its tracking gets me excited to use it on everything!
