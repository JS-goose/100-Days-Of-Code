# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 27: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I finished lesson 21 "Working With Browser Events" and then added the HTML skeleton to a freelance website I'm working on (pro bono) for a local charity.

**Thoughts:** I may have bitten off more than I can chew with this charity project, the Udacity Nanodegree, and my regular job.  I'm confident I can manage the schedule but not sure I'll be able to meet all the deadlines...here's hoping :)
