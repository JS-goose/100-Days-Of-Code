# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 20: May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I learned about the `spread` operator and `rest` parameter in JavaScript, finished two quizzes about them, and then started the Shell Workshop portion of my nanodegree.

**Thoughts:** The `spread` and `rest` operators (both use `...`) and seem fairly straightforward but I know there is much more to them.  I going to find some practice problems to complete using each of them in different ways to help solidify the knowledge I gained today.
