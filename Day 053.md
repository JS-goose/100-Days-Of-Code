# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 53: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* More work in section 3.8.2 (Callbacks)
* Finished 2 quizzes in the section
* Practiced using some array methods (`.filter(), .map(), .forEach()`) that are callback functions
* Updated some CSS and HTML elements on the freelance project I'm working on


**Thoughts:** I really enjoy this nanodegree but I will be glad when October rolls around and I'm finished with it.  I'm eager to put all these new skills I'm learning to use on more freelance gigs.  I'm holding off so I do not overwhelm myself though.
