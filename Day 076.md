# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 76: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Arcade Game passed!
* Started and finished sections 3.14 - 3.15
* Installed Gulp and practiced writing functions within `gulpfile.js`
* Work on freelance gig #3 has begun!

**Thoughts:** 
I'm having issues getting Gulp to work correctly with Browser Sync but I'm not ready to give up.  The benefits to my work flow could be gigantic!
