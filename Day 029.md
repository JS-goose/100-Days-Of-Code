# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 29: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the lesson on performance and practiced testing some code.  Went back to some old projects and tested out the code on those as well.  Also practiced some of the Git commands I learned earlier.

**Thoughts:** I've read some articles on code performance now and it stresses me out having to think about all of these issues when writing code.  It's good to think about these things when writing code but sometimes it can get overwhelming.
