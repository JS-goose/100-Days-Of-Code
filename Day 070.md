# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 70: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.12
* Started work on the Arcade Game replica
* Went over the starter code to understand all relevant functions
* Refactored the code into ES6 classes and constructors
* Got the board to appear and added in extra blocks for the player to use 
* Got the character to render on the board
* Worked on the freelance project adding relevant links



**Thoughts:**
I've had a lot of fun working on the arcade game but I think I bit off more than I can chew with other projects.  Freelance gigs, class, studying, being a parent, and all that comes along with being an adult are starting to overwhelm me.
