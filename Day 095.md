# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 95: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 4.1.12
* Debugging an issue with semantic tags not rendering `CSS Grid` properly
* Version 1 of cat clicker complete!

**Thoughts:** 
Working on the cat clicker project has been fun and reminded me how much I have missed making visually appealing pages.
