# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 39: May 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 17 
* learned and practiced `git rebase` and learned (the hard way) how it can be used inadvertently to delete commits
* started and finished lesson 18 (staying in sync with a remote repo)
* Moved on to Unit 3 - Accessibility (sometimes shortened to `A11y`)
* Started learning accessibility techniquest with JavaScript

**Thoughts:** There is another world centered around making web apps accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities (permanent, temporary, or situational).  I am sad to admit I had not thought about this at all until this lesson, time to change up some of my coding practices to include accessibility techniques.
