# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 97: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Fixed the issue with semantic tags not displaying the grid correctly - spelling error :(
* Added copyright section and social media links
* Started working on the logic of the clicker app
* Classes and constructor function established

**Thoughts:** 
The `HTML` and `CSS` were fun to work with but it's nice to mix it up and get some `JavaScript` in there too!
