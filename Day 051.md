# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.8.1 (First Class Functions)
* learned that functions are given the same status as other data structures in JavaScript
* learned that functions are actually a type of object
* Started learning about callbacks and how to access the inner function


**Thoughts:** I feel like this section is going to be rough for me as I'm having trouble wrapping my head around some of the theory concepts.  Callbacks make sense in paper but I keep asking myself what would a use case be for these?  I intend to find out!
