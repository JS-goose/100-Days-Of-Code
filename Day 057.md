# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 57: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.9.2 (Constructor functions)
* Learned about `instanceof` and how it relates to the objects built by constructor functions
* Started and finished section 3.9.3 (`this` value)
* Started section 3.9.4 (Setting the value of `this`)
* Practiced setting the value of `this` with the `.call()` method
* Learned that `.call()` can be used to essentially 'borrow' a method from one object and use it on another object

**Thoughts:** Today has been insanely productive and I have learned so much.  Object oriented programming has quickly become my favorite aspect of learning JavaScript thus far.  I'm chomping at the bit to use these new techniques on a project.
