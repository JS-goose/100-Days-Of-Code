# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 84: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section on Asynchronous code testing with Jasmine
* Finished section on Jasmine testing with JS
* Started looking through code base for the Udacity Feed Reader Project
* Edited card images on LSB site
* Added relative links on LSB site

**Thoughts:** 
I like the Jasmine testing and testing in general doesn't seem as bad as I thought it would be.  The LSB site is coming together nicely
