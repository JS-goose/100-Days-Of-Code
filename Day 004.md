# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I hit a snag with the drumkit project so I took a break and did some CSS work on a friend's site and then started the jQuery section of a web dev bootcamp on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Another day of hardly having time to code but I am glad I made time for this.  I feel like my CSS skills are getting stronger but my design skills are not (is that possible lol).  All in good time I suppose!
