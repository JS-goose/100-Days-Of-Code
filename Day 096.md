# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 96: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Reworked the grid on cat clicker to accommodate the new requirements
* Added styling to content section
* Added footer section

**Thoughts:** 
This project has been a great refresher on CSS Grid and Flexbox and I've enjoyed working with some `HTML` and `CSS` for a change!
