# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 40: June 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 3.1 
* Started lesson 3.2 (Focus)
* learned and practiced using `tabindex` and how it affects `tab order`
* learned about focus management and how to focus something programmatically with `.focus()`
* practiced using `skip links` and `roving focus` practices

**Thoughts:** This has been a very informative unit thus far and I have enjoyed learning about accessibility practices.  I'm going to implement some of the things I learned about in older projects as well.  I have a list of them!
