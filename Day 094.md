# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 94: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Feed Reader project passed!
* Fixed the grid on Cat Clicker v1
* Cat Clicker v2 finished - 2 cats with click events now display number of clicks
* Still debugging issue with semantic tags not responding to `CSS Grid`

**Thoughts:** 
I'm happy that project 4 passed and I can continue with my Cat Clicker app.  This nanodegree has been a fun/insightful ride thus far!
