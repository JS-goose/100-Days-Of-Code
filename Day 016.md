# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I'm still working through my portfolio site but offsetting the columns has proven difficult.  For now I have it centered using two empty `div` elements taking up space on either side.  This will need to change before I submit it for review. 

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap hasn't been awful, but I've been flipping through the docs for about an hour.  I feel better about my knowledge on the framework.  The next project I think I'll either hand code or use something like Materialze.
