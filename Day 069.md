**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.11.22
* Started and finished sections 3.11.23 - 3.12.10
* Learned about generator functions and passing to and extracting out data with the `yield` keyword
* Started section about polyfils 



**Thoughts:** The sections leading up to the Arcade Game have been a great learning session about some of the outer aspects of the JavaScript environment.
