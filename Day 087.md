# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 87: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Still working on the CTA section of the LSB site - won't center properly
* Reviewed bootstrap docs for ideas on expanding containers
* Added containers above CTA section

**Thoughts:** 
Today was spent on the LSB site solely because it needs to go live in 1 day.
