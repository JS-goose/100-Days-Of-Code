# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 62: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Worked on using `this` with arrow functions
* More practice with converting "normal" functions to arrow functions
* Started section 3.10.10 (Default Function Parameters)

**Thoughts:** All of this learning has been great, but I'm really chomping at the bit to be working on a project.  I want to start knocking out some code and I'm hoping to get through these next few sections so I can start the project at the end of this section.
