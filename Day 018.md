# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: May 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  While I wait on my review to come back from my resubmitted Project 1 I started the JavaScript portion of the nanodegree.  I learned when to use `let` and `const` instead of `var`.  Also learned about hoisting.

**Thoughts:** I thought I knew when to use the new variable keywords but I was mistaken.  Learning how hoisting works has also changed my knowledge on scope.  It's great to be back in JavaScript!
