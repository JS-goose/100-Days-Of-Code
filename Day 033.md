# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 33: May 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on adding the supplied shuffle method to my cardList (works now), added a `setTimeout()` to flip cards back over if they aren't a match.

**Thoughts:** This project has become much more manageable after breaking it into smaller pieces.  Writing pseudo code has also been an enormous boon to me as well.  I look forward to working more on this project though!
