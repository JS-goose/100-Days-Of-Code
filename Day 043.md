# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 43: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished lesson 4 
* Started lesson 5, worked till 5.12
* learned and practiced new ARIA semantics like `labeledby` `aria-owns` and `aria-role`
* worked on the freelance site I'm building for a local charity (removed an issue that was causing side scrolling on the main content)

**Thoughts:** This section has been extremely difficult for me to understand and I've had to go back several times just to try and find my bearings, I won't give up though!
