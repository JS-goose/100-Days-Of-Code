# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 62: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started learning JavaScript classes (section 3.10.15)
* Learned that ES6 Classes are basically constructor functions + prototyopal inheritance rolled into a nice neat package

**Thoughts:** I just learned about constructor functions and how to use them.  Now I'm being told to change that line of thinking for a less syntactical replacement :D  I love that this industry moves fast but sometimes it's difficult to keep up!
