# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 32: May 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  More work on the logic of the memory game - added some styling to have the card icon hidden until a class is applied (via JS) and have been reworking the function logic.

**Thoughts:** Using some of the ES6 operators (`spread` namely) has proven useful in this project.  I've needed to turn a NodeList into an array and `spread` has made it effortless, thankfully!
