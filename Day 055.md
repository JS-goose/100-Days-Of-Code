# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 55: July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started and Finished section 3.8.6 (IIFEs - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
* Practiced using IIFEs and closures to create private scope for my functions

**Thoughts:** I've yet to learn when I would need to use an IIFE but I know there are use cases for them.  Maybe related to security or authentication?  Also, I'm still a bit rusty on closures and will need to do some more research on them.
