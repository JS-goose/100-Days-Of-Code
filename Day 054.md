# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 54: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished section 3.8.3 (Callbacks)
* Started and finsihed section 3.8.4 (Scope)
* Learned about the scope chain, runtime scope, and that JavaScript is a function scoped language
* Started section 3.8.5 (Closures)

**Thoughts:** The section on scoping was super interesting and it really tied in what (little) I knew about scoping in JavaScript.  Seeing the scope chain in action was awesome and I found myself thinking of all the possibilities it held for future projects!
