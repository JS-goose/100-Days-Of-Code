# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 35: May 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Reset functionality works now (after 4 hours total work), worked on adding in a timer with `setInterval`and got it work but not in the format I wanted.  `clearInterval` has been my friend but I haven't learned how to restart the timer without reloading the page.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to build all of this project by myself but after spending roughly 8 hours total on the timer I decided to use a snipet from Stack Overflow and provide attribution in my code.  It made me feel bad at first but I quickly squashed those feelings, I'll get there as long as I keep my head up!
