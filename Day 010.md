# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: April 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished up break points (I believe I have a decent handle on them) and started working on the flexbox section of my nanodegree.  Completed some problems on Grid Garden and started Flexbox Froggy

**Thoughts:** For the longest time I feared starting the learn flexbox (not sure why).  I feel like flexbox is easier to learn than Grid.  I have a feeling that I will be using Flexbox in all of my layouts as it seems extremely powerful for 1D layouts.
