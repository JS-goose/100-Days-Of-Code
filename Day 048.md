# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 48: June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started section 3.7.3 - Invoking Object Methods
* Learned that functions (methods) can be invoked by either dot or bracket notation 
* Practiced invoking methods in the console


**Thoughts:** It feels good to be back in the saddle and coding again.  The wedding went off without a hitch and the honeymoon was amazing!  Now, back to work on this Udacity nanodegree to meet the Oct. 24th deadline!
