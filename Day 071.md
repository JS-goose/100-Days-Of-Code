# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 71: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* More work on the Arcade Game
* Working on trying to figure out why my functions aren't working
* Defining up/down and left/right functions 
* Board had to be reset to default size, will try to add extra blocks later


**Thoughts:** The game and working with object-oriented JavaScript are fun.  I haven't had this much fun coding a project since I started teaching myself to code.
