# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 31: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Continuing work on Project 2 for Udacity nanodegree - added some basic styling to the play area and began working on the logic portion of the card "flipping" action when clicked.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited but nervous about this project.  I'm not entirely comfortable with every aspect needed to finish this project and I'm feeling the pressure from the suggested deadline of Monday the 28th.
