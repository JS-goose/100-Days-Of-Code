# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 91: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* More Jasmine testing
* Worked on and finished the code for the menu test suite (testing that the menu is hidden by default)
* Used Jasmine's `beforeEach()` and `done()` functions to test asynchronous code 
* Finished code for Feed Reader project and submitted for review!

**Thoughts:** 
Project 4 is moving along smoothly and I'm enjoying learning more about Jasmine.  These test suites seem easy to write so either I'm doing it wrong or I had a completely skewed perspective of code testing.
