# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 34: May 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Refactored functions for memory game, added reset button with functionality, got my cards to lock in open position once a match was found (push cards to an array, check if both cards have an attribute and if they're the same, push to matchedCards array), and added functionality to change background upon successful match.

**Thoughts:** This project has been stressful but also extremely fun to build.  The power of HTML/CSS combined with JS never stops amazing me!
