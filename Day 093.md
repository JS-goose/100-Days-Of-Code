# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 93: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Refactored async code for Feed Reader Testing to meet review standards (again)
* Resubmitted for review
* First iteration of Cat Clicker established
* Debugging issue with semantic tags not responding to `CSS Grid` - work in progress

**Thoughts:** 
Refactoring the async tests has proven to be the most stressful part of this project but I'm hopeful I got them right this time :D
