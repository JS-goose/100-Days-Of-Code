# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 85: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Installed banner image for LSB site
* Created logo from banner image 
* Spent an hour debugging code as the drawer on mobile was not closing properly (`style.css` was being parsed before `bootstrap.css`)
* Removed unused code

**Thoughts:** 
Today was spent on the LSB site solely because it needs to go live in 3 days.
