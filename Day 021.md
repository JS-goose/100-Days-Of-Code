# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 21: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Continuing with the shell workshop, I learned and practiced some terminal commands such as:
* `ls`
* `ls -l`
* `pwd`
* `cd`
* `mv`
* `mkdir`

**Thoughts:** I have this irrational (justified?) fear of working with the terminal because I think I could easily mess something up or corrupt/destroy files.  I'm not sure where this fear came from but I'm working on overcoming it by spending a good amount of time with the shell.
