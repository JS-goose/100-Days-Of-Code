# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 28: May 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Started working on lesson 22 about Performance where I learned and practiced testing code with `performance.now()` and how to use `setTimeout()` to delay the execution of code.

**Thoughts:** Code testing is fun and this lesson has opened my eyes to a whole new world of optimized code writing.
